"""
One and only object of a given type, provides a global access.
Solves: Avoid conflicting requests
Problem: Violates Single responsability principle
Steps: 
    - private constructor, stop other objects to use dunder now
    - static creation method that act out as a constructor, 
    calls private constructor under the hood, return cached object.
